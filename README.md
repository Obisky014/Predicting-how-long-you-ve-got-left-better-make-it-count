This consists of a python code to try to predict/analyze lif expectancy through some diseases and other shall we say, miscellaneous factors.
I used a linear Regression to try to predict the model and then r-squared and mean squared error as evaluation metrics.
If you feel you got any more to add to this, go ahead.
